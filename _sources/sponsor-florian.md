# Sponsor Florian

I've been doing free community work for almost 20 years and am seeking personal sponsorship. For detailed reasoning, see [Sustainability](/sustainability).

To help out, [get in touch](mailto:info@asquera.de).

## From whom?

I am interested in professional, corporate and company donors of any size.

I'm also fine with conferences and can even offer consulting in return. I don't do diversity consulting.

## How much?

I'm seeking at least EUR 15.000 for 2018, either in one-off payments or monthly. I prefer to accept your sponsorship through my company, [asquera](http://asquera.de), for ease. We can also negotiate other forms.

More sponsorship would allow me to do more things.

To help out, [get in touch](mailto:info@asquera.de).

## What does this money help finance?

Mainly Time. I'm currently involved and/or helping the following projects:

* [Rust Berlin/Rust Hack & Learn](https://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/)
* [Rust project global community team](https://rust-lang.org/teams.html)
  - answering community requests
  - leading the events subteam
  - helping global conferences to be better conferences
  - content team contributor
  - On-site person at community events
* [The Rust YouTube account](https://youtube.com/c/rustvideos)
* [RustFest](https://rustfest.eu)
* [helping out Rust LATAM](https://twitter.com/RustLatamConf)
* [impl days](https://paris.rustfest.eu/about_impl_days/)
* [Ruby Berlin e.V.](http://rubyberlin.org/)
* [OpenTechSchool e.V.](http://www.opentechschool.org/)
* [Mozilla TechSpeakers](https://wiki.mozilla.org/TechSpeakers)
* [IsleOfRuby](https://2018.isleofruby.org/)
* [RubyOnIce](https://rubyonice.com/2018)

Currently, most of this work happens on evenings. Your support would also allow me to refocus on non-Rust things again.

Beyond that, I have a lot of experience that could be of benefit to the wider FOSS community. I would like to spread/write down:

* How to plan and run affordable conferences, especially around budgeting

* How to run fair and diverse conferences

* How to interact with conferences

* Approaches to community development

* Writing proposals and speaker mentoring

One of those projects is the [FOSS events planner](https://github.com/rust-community/foss-events-planner/). It's under the umbrella of the Rust project, but open and intended for all.

## What is this sponsorship not for?

Expenses and travel, especially speaking expenses. These are either paid by conferences I speak at or through other means.

## What will I provide?

A regular writeup and worklog of things done, at least once a month. For sponsors over 1000 Euros, we can set up a phone call where I answer all of your questions on FOSS development. On larger sponsorships (>5000), we can also negotiate additional agreements. Also, I'll present all sponsors on this website and give you thanks :).
